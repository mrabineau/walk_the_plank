WALK THE PLANK

Walk the Plank is essentially your classic hangman. But with pirates.

Your goal is to guess the given word correctly, before your pirate is forced to walk off the the plank and into the unforgiving waters of the South Pacific. 

You are allowed ten incorrect guesses. 

Make your guess by clicking on one of the letter buttons at the top of the screen. Once you press a button, it’s button form will disappear and the letter will reappear in either the blue or red box, depending on whether your guess is correct or incorrect. This way you can keep track of what you’ve tried. 

Correct guesses will not appear in order. These are (mostly) simple words and we are all literate so it is your job to unscramble in order to make increasingly educated guesses. All of the words are thematically relevant so think nautically.

Last off; I know we are extremely busy important individuals but please allow all animations to run fully before making your next guess, otherwise my precious javascript animations get stressed out. Just wait for the button on the right hand side to read “Guess again.” 

Once you have won or lost, refresh the page to play again. And again. And again…

PLANNED FEATURES

Eventually, there will be a reset button at the end of a game so that you don’t have to refresh to page to continue playing. 

Also, hints will be included if it seems you are struggling.

Potentially, the game will eventually be broken into different levels based on word complexity.

Also, sounds will be incorporated.
